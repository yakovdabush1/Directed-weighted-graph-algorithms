## Description of the game:
In this Pokemon game you have to manage a group of agents whose goal is to capture
As many Pokemon as possible (before the scenario / game runs out of time.)
The more Pokemon you catch, the more points you earn.
There are many types of arenas and scenarios / stages, you must choose which scenario / stage you want to play in our login system.
The movement in the board is on a weighted directed graph (the possible route)
The Pokemon are randomly scattered across the board and agents can catch them by traversing them through the graph in addition to when an agent catches a Pokemon a new one will appear in its place randomly.
